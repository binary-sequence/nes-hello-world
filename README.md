# nes-hello-world
Hello world example in NES 6502 assembler for ca65/ld65

The NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), known as famicom in Japan cannot handle text.
Instead, it is made to hanlde graphics.

Because showing the text "hello, world!" requires complex handling of grapchis, a different approach is usually used as NES hello world.

The most common approach is to just change the background color of the screen.
